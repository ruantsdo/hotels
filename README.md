# Hotel registration website

This project was created to obtain approval in one of the subjects of my undergraduate course in information systems at UNEB Alagoinhas.   
The purpose of this project is to register hotels on the platform and be able to carry out searches by searching for the name of the hotel.   
The project has a registration and login system using firebase and a database system to register and remove the hotel also using firebase.
## Notices ⚠️

The functions of registration, user login and hotels in this project may be inactive due to the pre-established time limit of firebase. In order for these functions to work normally, it is necessary to update the "firebase.js" file in the "services" folder with valid credentials of a properly configured firebase.
